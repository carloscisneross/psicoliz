The previous AI engineer successfully developed Liz Parra's appointment booking website from scratch. The initial phase focused on building the core UI, integrating branding, and implementing the multi-step booking flow with PayPal and Zelle payments. Email notifications were set up using Brevo. A major phase involved adding a comprehensive admin panel for Liz to manage appointments, confirm Zelle payments, and view statistics. Extensive refinement included fixing environment-specific issues like Invalid Host header and dynamic backend URL resolution for preview environments. Key features added dynamically configurable Zelle payment details, consultation pricing, and extended session options, all manageable via the admin dashboard. A sophisticated time slot management system was implemented, allowing weekly schedules and date-specific overrides. The most recent work involves migrating the frontend and backend to use a Render-deployed backend URL, which is currently ongoing, resolving backend 404 issues and ensuring seamless production connectivity.

The goal is to build a modern appointment booking website for psychologist Liz Parra, matching her flyer branding (blush pink, golden brown headings, floral accents, circular profile photo). The homepage features her name, title, license, and an Agendar Cita button. The booking flow allows users to select date/time, input personal details, and choose payment via PayPal, NowPayments (later replaced with Brevo SMTP for emails), or Zelle. PayPal should offer automated checkout; Zelle requires instructions and receipt upload. Confirmation emails (user and Liz, with Zelle receipt attachment) are crucial. WhatsApp is the sole session method. Liz needs an admin panel to view/manage appointments, confirm Zelle payments, and download bookings. Footer links for Instagram and WhatsApp are required. The site must be soft, professional, responsive, and use VET timezone. Dynamic pricing for standard and extended sessions (30/60 min) should be configurable, and Zelle deposit email and availability time slots editable via the admin panel. Finally, connect the application to a Render-hosted backend.

<key_technical_concepts>
- Full-Stack Development (React, FastAPI, MongoDB)
- UI/UX: Tailwind CSS, Glass Morphism
- Payment Gateways: PayPal Sandbox, Zelle (manual confirmation with file upload)
- Email Service: Brevo SMTP
- Environment Management: .env, Supervisor, Kubernetes Ingress
- Data Handling: MongoDB (UUIDs for IDs), Base64 for image uploads
- Authentication: HTTP Basic Auth for Admin Panel
- Dynamic Configuration: Runtime-configurable pricing and scheduling
- Scheduling Logic: Weekly defaults, custom date overrides, conflict prevention
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB for data persistence.



-   ****: This is the core of the FastAPI backend. It defines all API routes (prefixed with ), handles database interactions with MongoDB (appointments, settings, schedules), manages payment integrations (PayPal, Zelle logic), and sends emails via Brevo SMTP. It also includes admin authentication. Recent changes include:
    *   Adding a  root route for health check.
    *   Robust loading of all environment variables with  and default values.
    *   Endpoints for  management (Zelle email, consultation pricing, extended session prices).
    *   Endpoints for  management (weekly defaults, custom date overrides).
    *   Logic for dynamic pricing based on session duration.
-   ****: Contains sensitive API keys (PayPal, Brevo), MongoDB URL, and configurable application-specific variables like Liz's email, , etc.
-   ****: The main React component that sets up routing for the application, including the homepage, booking flow, payment status pages, and admin panel. It also renders the main layout elements like header and footer. Changes include adding the admin route and dynamic image loading.
-   ****: Implements the admin dashboard UI and logic. It handles authentication, displays appointment statistics, lists bookings, manages Zelle confirmations, and provides interfaces for  (Zelle email, pricing) and  (schedule management). Extensive changes were made to fix login issues, incorporate dynamic URLs, and add multiple tabs for settings and scheduling.
-   ****: Manages the multi-step appointment booking process, including date/time selection, personal information input, session duration selection, and payment method choice. It interacts with backend APIs to fetch available time slots, submit booking data, and integrate with PayPal/Zelle. Changes involve fixing API URL construction, integrating dynamic pricing for session types, and displaying current settings.
-   ** / **: These files define environment variables for the React frontend, primarily  to point to the FastAPI backend and  for development previews. The  was modified to dynamically determine the backend URL based on  or fallback to , and then updated explicitly to  for Render deployment.
-   ****: A newly created file to centralize the  for all frontend API calls, ensuring consistency and easy updates for deployment.
-   ****: Configures how the frontend and backend services run within the environment, including their working directories, commands, and environment variables.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully connect the frontend to the Render-deployed backend URL for all API calls.
- Confirm all backend environment variables are correctly loaded and utilized from the Render environment.
- Verify the 404 root route fix on the Render deployment.
- The initial requirement for NowPayments for PagoMÃ³vil was mentioned but not explicitly implemented; Brevo SMTP was used for email instead.

<current_work>
Currently, the primary focus is on fixing the backend's 404 root route and ensuring the frontend properly connects to the FastAPI backend hosted on Render ().

The AI engineer has performed the following actions:
1.  **Backend ():**
    *   Added a new root route () returning  to resolve the 404 issue on the base URL.
    *   Confirmed all existing  routes are correctly registered.
    *   Ensured all critical environment variables (, , , , , , , ) are loaded robustly using  with default values where appropriate.
    *   Updated Zelle configuration functions to explicitly use environment variables.
2.  **Frontend ():**
    *   Updated  in both  and  to .
    *   Created a new file, , to centralize the  as .
    *   Modified key frontend components (, , , ) to import and use this  for all backend API calls, replacing previous  or dynamic  constructions. This involved several bulk edits to ensure all API calls correctly reference the new centralized URL.

The last action in the trajectory was the AI engineer preparing to test the new backend root route to confirm its functionality.

<optional_next_step>
Test the backend root route () to confirm it returns the expected Backend is running message.
